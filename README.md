# Time-Series-Analysis

This project explores **time series forecasting** using **Meta's Prophet** package in R. The analysis focuses on financial data, particularly **Northrop Grumman's stock prices** and other S&P 500 stocks, to detect trends, seasonality, and future projections.

## 📂 Files in This Repo
- **`Time Series Prophet.Rmd`** – The main R Markdown file containing the data analysis and forecasting. Feel free to copy the code and edit it in your local environment if you are interested.
- **`Time-Series-Prophet.html.zip`** – The rendered HTML report. Just unzip the html file to view if you are

## 🔧 Installation & Setup
To run this project, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed in R:

```r
install.packages("prophet")
install.packages("quantmod")
```

## 📈 How to Run the Analysis
1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/omegaab04/Time-Series-Analysis.git
   cd Time-Series-Analysis
   ```
2. **Open the R Markdown file** (`.Rmd`) in RStudio.
3. **Knit the document** to generate the HTML report.

## 📌 Key Features
- **Forecasting stock prices** using Prophet.
- **Time series decomposition** to analyse trends and seasonality.
- **Log return calculations** for financial time series analysis.
- **Visualisation of predictions** using base R plots.

I am likely to implement **ARIMA models** in the near future and work on more defense stocks given the current situation in the EU and North America. 
There might be money to be made here.
